## P8 active — S26a-1 closed; S26a-2 next

P8 opened on 2026-05-11. S26 split per D86 into S26a (methodology v3 migration with role aggregate) and S26b (McKinsey 7-Step authoring against the role-first model). S26a further split at scope-meets-reality into S26a-1 (control-plane work) and S26a-2 (per-tenant work).

**S26a-1 closed on 2026-05-12.** Six commits landed: control-plane Alembic 0005_role_tables + 0006_methodology_role_refs + 0007_lvt_split (all forward-and-back-verified against live Postgres); role aggregate within `contexts/methodology/` with full hexagonal layout (domain, port, postgres adapter, five use cases); methodology refactor to role_refs with hash re-anchoring at the migration boundary; role-aware MethodologyLookupAdapter at `apps/cli/_cross_context.py`; LVT methodology + LVTGuide role split via the rename migration; round-trip integration test exercising the role-first composition end-to-end through methodology + role + adapter; 157 methodology/role/agent/CLI/tenant-isolation tests pass; import-linter's 23 contracts kept; AST enforcement passes. Pre-write reconciliations applied: control-plane Alembic numbering aligns with the actual versions directory (`0005`/`0006`/`0007`); `RoleRepositoryPort` lives at `contexts/methodology/ports/role_repository.py` matching the same-context port convention; brief preserved at `briefs/p8/s26a-1.md`.

**S26a-2 next.** Per-tenant work continues against the original S26a brief at `briefs/p8/s26a-1.md` (commits 5 through 7 of the original brief): per-tenant Alembic adding `source_role_id` + `source_role_version` to `agent_templates` with paired-null CHECK, `AgentTemplate` domain extension, `create_agent_from_role` use case, `RoleLookup` cross-context port + adapter, `RoleView` consumer-side DTO, `padhanam role` CLI namespace with five commands, `padhanam agent create-from-role`, tenant isolation contract tests, import-linter / AST enforcement updates. The S25 docker-based clone-and-edit e2e (currently skipped) restores at S26a-2 once role authoring becomes operator-callable through the CLI.

P8-internal architectural anchor: roles are first-class primary aggregates per D86. Methodology is a playbook composing roles via `role_refs` plus workflow specification plus per-role overrides; methodology v2 from D81 (roles JSONB embedded on methodology) was skipped in favour of v3 directly. The role-first commitment shapes the rest of P8: S27b's agent runtime invokes against role-bound or methodology-bound agents; S28b's tool registry binds classifications via the role's `tool_allowlist`; the four-layer constraint stack from D80 reads as a five-concept stack per D86 (platform invariants, role envelope, methodology overlay, workflow orchestration, agent instance).

## Carryovers active across the P7→P8 boundary

- **Hierarchical multi-agent topology design.** Closed at strategic-mode commit 6f66f71 (D80 through D85). Role-first refinement (D86) closed at this commit.
- **Layer A policy authoring.** Follow-on strategic block authoring
  the ten policy scaffolds at `charter/compliance/` per the
  compliance-as-shared-responsibility principle. Scheduled at
  operator discretion between P7 build sessions or after P7 close;
  does not block any P7 build session because the substrate (D-entries
  D69-D73, the principle, the scaffold structure) is in place. Authoring
  effort estimated at one strategic block session.
- **Retrieval-evaluation design session.** Queued strategic-mode
  conversation ahead of P11 (recommendation engine). The audience
  is the existing eval harness from P5 and the optimisation layer
  at P11; the design space (gold-set construction, offline versus
  online relevance signals, recall@k versus precision@k tradeoffs,
  test corpus shape) warrants its own focused session at the
  audience-relevant moment. Must-have for the bet's optimisation
  claim because the optimisation layer has to distinguish retrieval
  failures from reasoning failures; deferred at the data-retrieval
  design session on Kano-versus-RICE asymmetry grounds (must-have
  on Kano, high effort on RICE relative to its on-runtime impact).
- **Product methodology selection-space.** P7 commits to LVT as
  the first methodology per D68; the LVT methodology template
  lands at S25. Other methodologies in
  [charter/product-methodology.md](product-methodology.md)
  activate as evidence pulls them in (operator authors as needed);
  per-domain methodology selection surfaces at the framing of each
  domain-bearing package.
- **Production CLI tenant resolution via the registry.** Phase 2
  shape; `apps/cli/_runtime.py`'s hardcoded test-set mapping is
  honest about its dev-only scope. Activates when production
  deployment context arrives.
- **Multi-baseline regression reports.** Deferred per D58;
  single-baseline at S18. Activates at P11's recommendation
  engine when run-history infrastructure exists from P9.
- **PRFAQ phase-audit refresh.** Cadence per D45 (every phase
  audit). The v2 PRFAQ from the P4-post carryover-cleanup
  strategic session stands until the Phase 1 close audit. The
  Phase 1 close audit refresh additionally absorbs the dogfooding
  scenario acknowledgment per D77 and D78 (operator runs a private
  deployment for personal use as evidence of D14's customer-
  deployment scenario).
- **Personal-use deployment of public Padhanam (Phase C).**
  Operator-controlled deployment of public Padhanam as a real
  instance of the customer-deployment scenario per D78, exercising
  D14's configuration + tools + bounded-extensions model. Phase C
  activates concretely after P8 close (when agent runtime exists);
  preparatory work (operator-authored tool services and methodology
  template authoring) can start after P7 close in parallel with P8
  build, subject to operator capacity per the all-or-nothing
  posture. PRFAQ acknowledgment lands at the next phase audit.
- **Calendar tool service as platform capability.** Deferred-
  decisions entry per the P7 mid-package strategic block on
  consumer-direction placement; activation when public Padhanam
  needs a calendar integration for any package work or when the
  personal-use deployment Phase C activates per D78, whichever
  comes first.
- **Email tool service as platform capability.** Deferred-decisions
  entry, same activation shape as the calendar tool entry.
- **Scheduled-runs primitive.** Deferred-decisions entry; activates
  when public Padhanam needs scheduled agent execution (likely P11
  or P12 territory) or when personal-use deployment Phase C needs
  daily-review-style triggers, whichever comes first. Two
  implementation candidates (platform primitive versus external
  trigger); choice settles when implementation begins.

## Deferred items remaining visible

- **Per-tenant Neo4j topology.** Activated at S21 per D63 with
  Phase 1 shared-instance + property-based scoping; the
  deferred-decisions entry remains as the production-deployment
  revisit marker with three named triggers (residency, blast
  radius, security-review).
- **Within-tenant segmentation primitive.** Held in the P6-open
  strategic-block conversation; activates at the consumer-driven
  session that demands it (likely P8 agent runtime). No schema
  commitment at P6 beyond tenant.
- **Classification field on TenantContext.** Deferred per S15
  framing decision option C; lands at the package that genuinely
  consumes it (P7 or P8 per the P4 epic note's out-of-scope
  section). TenantContext at P6 close still carries three fields,
  not four; adding the field later is a one-line edit on the
  value object plus a registry-row column.
- **Cost-ceiling forward-affordance columns.** Configuration
  columns landed at S14 alongside the cost-attribution column per
  D41. Reading and enforcing the columns defers to Phase 2 per
  [charter/deferred-decisions.md](deferred-decisions.md).
- **Pricing-table monthly review.** Cadence in
  `ops/scheduled_checks.yaml` per D41; first run scheduled
  2026-06-05.
- **Pricing-table format evolution.** S14 reflection forward-note;
  the format-(b) Pydantic + dict shape evolves to YAML/TOML under
  `ops/` when multi-region rates, time-zoned rates, or rate-card
  complexity arrives. Phase 2 framing.
- **PRFAQ operator-voice rewrite.** Follow-on strategic
  conversation, queued at operator discretion.
- **Phase 1 PRD operator-review** of the problem-statement and
  target-user sections. Operator discretion.
- **Production-shaped tenant onboarding workflow** (full D13
  implementation): awaits production deployment context.
- **Cross-replica cache invalidation for the routing layer**
  (D36): single-replica dev makes this a non-issue.
- **Hash chain caching as a performance optimisation** (D37):
  deferred until measurement justifies.
- **Methodology mechanical-enforcement upgrades.** Tracked in
  [charter/deferred-decisions.md](deferred-decisions.md). The
  framing-prompt-as-recommendation and pre-write reconciliation
  promotions at this commit move two items off the
  Patterns-observed candidate list onto the prescriptive
  principle surface; the user-driven course-correction Patterns-
  observed entry lands at the same commit.
- **Platform-baseline scoring sheet library** (deferred per D53;
  activates at real onboarding flow or a cross-tenant curated
  library with a real consumer).
- **Human-review UI for evaluation** (deferred per D53; lands at
  P10 or P11 territory).
- **Multi-currency cost reporting** (deferred per the strategic
  commit `24561c9` deferred-decisions entry; activates at the
  Phase 2 multi-region deployment context).
- **Per-criterion cost breakdowns in
  `CostPerSuccessfulTaskResult`** (P11 territory).
- **Calibration learning loops over `automated_score` vs
  `human_score`** (P11 territory; data substrate lives at
  rubric_applications per D55).
- **Trace_id-based recommendation queries beyond
  cost-per-successful-task** (P11 territory).
- **HTTP API for ingestion management** (deferred per the P6
  out-of-scope; CLI is the user surface at P6; HTTP API ships
  when a UI consumer arrives at P9 or P10).
- **HTTP API for evaluation management** (deferred; activates
  when a UI consumer arrives at P10 or P11).
- **Sheet/interaction-set management commands in the CLI**
  (deferred; activates when CRUD UI is needed).
- **Personalization as a runtime concern.** Deferred-decisions
  entry from P6 mid-package absorption (Ask David external
  reference); activates at P8 agent runtime or whichever
  predecessor orchestration session demands it.
