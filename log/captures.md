# Captures

Mid-session catch surface per D48. Append-only. Stray thoughts during sessions go here so they neither derail the current session nor get lost.

Triage at session close (or at package close for less time-critical captures): each entry classified into one of five impact types, then either acted on, deferred, or archived.

Triage taxonomy:

- **quick task** — small enough to handle this session.
- **inject** — insert into the current package's session sequence.
- **defer** — forward to the next package or to `charter/deferred-decisions.md`.
- **replan** — large enough to warrant rethinking scope; trigger course-change in `charter/roadmap.md`.
- **note** — record only; no action implied.

Format per entry:

```
- YYYY-MM-DD [session-id] capture text
  - triaged: <classification> on YYYY-MM-DD
  - resolution: <what was done, or where it was forwarded>
```

## 2026-05-07 — Enterprise multi-agent QA system case study

Source: enterprise case study presented at the 2025 LangChain interrupt conference. Approach diagram and full transcript captured by the operator.

Architectural shape observed: domain-specific QA system with hierarchical multi-agent topology, intent-based routing to specialised sub-agents, runtime personalization conditioned on user role, reflection/judge gating before answer ships, memory layer for cross-conversation continuity, and human-in-the-loop escalation.

Observations and where each lands:

- **Hierarchical multi-agent topology with intent-routed subgraphs.** Design-session candidate; queued at P8 framing or as pre-P8 strategic block.
- **Personalization as a runtime concern** (same data renders differently based on user role). Landed as deferred-decisions entry this commit.
- **Build pattern: start simple, refactor often.** Landed as methodology discipline this commit.
- **Data retrieval as a multi-path architectural concern**, with each path having distinct evaluation needs and architectural posture. Design-session candidate; queued after P6 close, scope possibly large enough to earn package status on the roadmap.
  - triaged: design-session candidate on 2026-05-07
  - resolution: data-retrieval design session held 2026-05-07 between P6 close and P7 framing; output landed as D66 (hybrid composition architecture) and D67 (filter expression architecture); no package elevation needed because implementation lands in P7 (agent config schema) and P8 (runtime orchestrator and filter translator); retrieval-evaluation surface deferred to its own strategic-mode session ahead of P11 on Kano-versus-RICE asymmetry grounds.
- **Memory as a first-class agent surface.** Deferred-decision candidate; activates when an agent runtime use case demands cross-conversation context the audit and trace substrates cannot synthesise cleanly.
- **Runtime reflection as an orchestration node.** Deferred-decision candidate; activates when an agent runtime use case requires answer-quality gating before user surfacing.
- **Evaluation-driven development with sub-agent independent evaluation.** Corroborates Padhanam's eval-before-agent sequencing (P5 closed before P8 ships); no new commitment.

Bet corroboration: an enterprise of the kind Padhanam's bet names as the procurement test condition shipping this shape publicly is signal that the procurement-grade orchestration posture Padhanam architects toward is what enterprise teams actually deploy in 2025-2026. Worth citing at the Phase 1 close audit as enterprise reference architecture. Padhanam's own architecture may end up looking different; the corroboration value is in the procurement-grade posture, not in the specific implementation choices.
